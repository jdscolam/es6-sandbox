# es6-sandbox
A quick place to mess around with es6 stuff.

Great news!  This is now connected to our #Slack!

Currently we have the following:
- Transpiling to ES5 "dist" folder (WebStorm File-Watcher based)
- DI/IoC
- TDD/BDD (Mocha based using WebStorm test runner)
- npm based execution of the TDD/BDD tests
- 'build-prod' Gulp task (in ES6!) that excludes the *.spec.js files when building prod

TODO:
- Gulp based transpiling to ES5 "dist" folder without breaking the WebStorm File-Watcher
